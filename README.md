This is the new Brand View login page. The purpose of this repository is to be able to work on the code remotely without Brand View running on your machine.

Please do not change anything unless you've discussed it with [Adam](https://github.com/adampoczatek).

## How to run it:

  - Clone repository
  - Navigate to the folder using terminal
    - Run `npm install` (only once)
    - Run `bower install` (only once)
    - Run `grunt build` (only once)
    - Run `grunt watch` (every time you work on the project)

It will be simplified later.
